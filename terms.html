Note about "Invite Friends" feature:&nbsp;If you choose to invite

or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are
responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device,

control this communication.<br>
<br>
Analytics information:<br>
<br>
We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends
for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our
Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that
assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics
information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot
reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.<br>
<br>
Cookies and similar technologies:<br>
<br>
When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like
pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use
Latino Toons and provide features to you.<br>
<br>
We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your
devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the
third party.<br>
<br>
More information is available in our&nbsp;About Cookies&nbsp;section<br>
<br>
Log file information:<br>
<br>
Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you
make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be
provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser
or device.<br>
<br>
When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file
information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP")
address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and
how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages
viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information
from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened
and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more
accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.<br>
<br>
Device identifiers:<br>
<br>
When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we
may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one
or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files
or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device,
which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data
stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with
the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device
by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.latinotoonscomix.com/terms" target="_blank"><span style="color:#263238">vicman.mx</span></a>.<br>
<br>
A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner
about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide
reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not
function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or
disabled.<br>
<br>
Metadata:<br>
<br>
Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For
example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content
was collected and how that content is formatted.<br>
<br>
Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a
hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark
your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content
more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag
your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored
with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your
photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.<br>
<br>
2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION<br>

In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this
Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:<br>

<br>
We also may share your information as well as information from tools like

organizations that help us provide the Service to you ("Service
Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your

among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be
of most interest to you.<br>
<br>
We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data
with other parties. We may also combine your information with other information
in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated

<br>
Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:<br>
<br>
Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the
Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled

request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good
faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to
legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a
good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction,
affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized
standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a
good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and
other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part
